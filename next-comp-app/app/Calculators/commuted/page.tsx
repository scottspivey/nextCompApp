          <p>
            <strong>General Information:</strong> Under South Carolina Code ยง 42-9-301, parties may agree to commute future compensation payments to
            present value when approved by the Workers&apos; Compensation Commission.
            This calculator uses the current S.C. Workers&apos; Compensation Commission approved discount rates: <strong>{displayDiscountRate}</strong> for claims with more than 100 weeks
            remaining and <strong>2%</strong> for claims with 100 weeks or fewer remaining.
            The calculator also provides values at <strong>95%</strong> and <strong>90%</strong> of the commuted value, which may be helpful in the evaluation of claims.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This calculator is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.
            While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy based on current South Carolina regulations and rates, users should independently
            verify all calculations and consult with qualified legal counsel before making any decisions based on these results.  
            <strong> Reliance on this tool is solely at the user&apos;s own risk.</strong>          
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note on Rounding:</strong> The South Carolina Workers&apos; Compensation Commission&apos;s official Net Present Value (NPV) tables
            round conversion factors to four decimal places. This calculator performs calculations using higher precision, which may result
            in minor variations compared to the official WCC published values.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note on NPV Formula Adjustment:</strong> To align with the methodology used in the official South Carolina Workers&apos; 
            Compensation Commission&apos;s Net Present Value (NPV) tables, this calculator incorporates an adjustment to the standard present value annuity 
            formula for calculations involving 101 to 500 weeks. Specifically, an additional week is included in the time period exponent, 
            mirroring the Commission&apos;s published factors. While this differs from standard financial calculations, it ensures results are consistent 
            with those expected based on the Commission&apos;s tables.
