          Calculate a claimant&apos;s Average Weekly Wage (AWW) and Compensation Rate based on their earnings 
          in the four quarters preceding the injury, in accordance with South Carolina law.

        <p className="mb-3">
          Per South Carolina Code ยง 42-1-40, the Average Weekly Wage is typically calculated by dividing 
          the employee&apos;s total wages from the four quarters preceding the injury by 52.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The Compensation Rate is then calculated as 66.67% (or 2/3) of the Average Weekly Wage, but cannot 
          exceed the maximum compensation rate for the year of injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          This calculator automatically applies the appropriate maximum compensation rate based on the 
          date of injury.
