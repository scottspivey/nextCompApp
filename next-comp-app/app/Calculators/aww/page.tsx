          <p>
            South Carolina law defines the primary method for calculating the average weekly wage in <code className="font-mono bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded">ยง 42-1-40</code>.
            Generally, if the employee worked for the employer for the full four quarters immediately preceding the injury, the AWW is the total gross earnings during those four quarters divided by 52 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The weekly compensation rate is typically two-thirds (66.67%) of the calculated AWW. However, this amount is subject to
            the <strong className="text-foreground">maximum weekly compensation rate</strong> set by the state for the specific year the injury occurred. Your compensation rate cannot exceed this maximum, regardless of how high your AWW is.
          </p>
          <p>
            The law also outlines <strong className="text-foreground">alternative calculation methods</strong> for situations where the employee worked less than four quarters, had concurrent employment, or falls into special categories (like certain volunteers). These methods can be more complex and may require information not included in this basic calculator.
          </p>
          <p>
             Always refer to the official statute or consult with a legal professional for guidance on specific cases.
