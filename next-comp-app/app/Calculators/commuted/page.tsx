        <p className="mb-3">
          Under South Carolina Code ยง 42-9-301, parties may agree to commute future compensation payments to 
          present value when approved by the Workers&apos; Compensation Commission.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          This calculator uses the current court-approved discount rates: 4.38% for claims with more than 100 weeks 
          remaining and 2% for claims with 100 weeks or fewer remaining.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The calculator also provides values at 95% and 90% of the commuted value, which are common settlement 
          percentages used in South Carolina workers&apos; compensation cases.
